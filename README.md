## I'm a Eduardo Parucker ðŸ‘‹

+10 years in the market working as a **Software Enginner / Entrepreneur**, with the main objective of raising the quality of products always aligned with the Business.

Currently I'm focused in new software architectures, learning new development languages, best practices and try leading @missionbrasil to ðŸ¦„.

The biggest challenge so far has been managing the Mission Brasil B2B2C platform, today with +60k registered people, +90 customers and +100,000 limits throughout the national territory. Using services such as AWS Lambda, SNS, RDS, EC2, we are managing to generate great results for our customers.

My experiences as **Software Enginner / Entrepreneur** before this challenge were very enriching, I was Co-founder of 3 startups, Bringgers, Restaurantes Floripa and Reservando, in all of them I did Fullstack Development, it was the period when I failed the most as an entrepreneur which brought many lessons.
